An end-to-end ELT pipeline to download, load into a database and transform  into key metrics [Freddie Mac Single Family Loan-Level Dataset](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset).
#### Project Motivation
My background is in economics and finance. I'm fascinated by quantitative risk management, particularly credit risk modelling. Accurately predicting how many and which borrowers will default allows banks and lending companies to make important strategic decisions. Needless to say, machine learning is a natural fit in this space. But beyond fancy neural networks and tree-based models, analytics remains critical to risk management. In this project, which marks the end of the [Dataexpert](https://www.dataexpert.io) Analytics Engineering Bootcamp V1, I decided to focus on analytics and discover the complexity and beauty behind simple time series and percentages.
